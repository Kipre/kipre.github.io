        <h1>Highlight code using neural networks</h1>
        
        <div style='font-size: smaller'>Cyprien Neverov, January 19, 2021</div>
        
        <h2>Where does this problem comes from?</h2>
        <p>I spent a few weeks writing my own <a href='https://kipre.github.io/ted/'>web-based text editor</a>. 
           This was already a quite hard task for me. My web developement skills are quite limited, however, modern javascript and web standards
           make it easier than it was a few years ago. The main challenges were linked to making it responsive enough to provide a good user 
           experience. I ended up creating a set of lines in the viewport and updating their content with respect to a custom scroll location.
           This allowed to drasticly reduce the number of DOM elements and thus keep the rendering time constant, as opposed to rendering the whole
           document, even if most of it is not visible, it takes time to compute the layout. The naive approach would start to loose scrolling smoothness
           as soon as documents had more than 2000 lines. 
           Overall I was quite happy with this preliminary result, at least in terms of functionality. It was absolutely clear, however, that it
           would not be possible to use it as a daily code editor if it wasn't able to highlight code.
        </p>
        <h2>How is code highlighted in other code editors?</h2>
        <p>I started to look at the different ways code editors are implementing syntax highlighting. The closest editor to my project is 
           <a href='https://codemirror.net/'>CodeMirror</a>, this is probably the most popular web based text editor, apparently it powers 
           Chrome Dev Tools, Jupyter and a big number of other important projects. I looked a few times at CodeMirror when I had some design questions 
           but overall I tried to come up with my own solutions. The current version of CodeMirror relies on an interface that allows to 
           implement a tokenizer and parser for every language and these parsers exist for almost a hundred different languages. 
           At first it seemed to be a good idea to somehow make these "languages" pluggable into my editor, but I soon realized that I would 
           have to write a lot of boilerplate to accomodate the differences in the ways the editors work.
        </p>
        <p>One important design choice of my editor was to rely on as little third party code as possible, and adapt it so that it can rely on some 
           internal code of another code editor was obviously not a solution. Then, I discovered that the creator of CodeMirror was working on the 
           <a href='https://codemirror.net/6/'>next version</a> of the editor and that they created a dedicated parser for this new version. 
           The parser is called <a href='https://lezer.codemirror.net/'>Lezer</a> and it is an attempt at solving the challenges that are 
           encountered in syntax highlighting:
           <ul>
               <li>must be general enough to adapt to any language;</li>
               <li>must provide fast incremental update of the parsed tree;</li>
               <li>must be robust enough not to brake in the presence of syntax errors.</li>
           </ul>
           This parser is inspired from another project called <a href='https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/'>Tree Sitter</a> that powers 
           syntax highlighting of the <a href='https://atom.io/'>Atom</a> editor and maybe some parts of GitHub. Tree Sitter is written in 
           Rust and C which makes its integration into a web project slightly harder.
        </p>
        <p>At this point, seeing how complex it is to create a highlight system, I thought that it might be a good idea to rely on AI for this task.
           Since modern models can achieve such amazing results for natural language, it should be easier for them to understand
           the structure of code.
        </p>
        <h2>Neural highlighting</h2>
        <h3>Simplest approach</h3>
        <p>I started with the simplest architecture I could imagine: a window of characters as the input and the category of the central character
           as the output.
        </p>
        <div style='text-align: center'>
            <img width='400px' src='assets/naive_nn.svg'></img>
        </div>
        <p>The problem with this approach is that it requires a lot of inferences to compute the highlighting of a single line (one per character).
           The next logical step was to have an input and an output window, the output window being smaller to give the model more context.
           This worked better but I still wasn't very happy with the highlighting results because the model was missclassifying some very obvious 
           letters (like inside language keywords).
        </p>
        <h3>Web Workers</h3>
        <p>One of my concerns when making the model bigger and bigger was that eventually the model would become too slow for real-time inference
           in the browser and would then make the UI unusable.
           When I made some tests in the editor I quickly realized that the UI froze way too much even for the smallest models.
           But if we delegate the inference to a web worker and update the view as soon as some highlighting results appear we are no longer 
           limited by the model size and the editor becomes responsive again.
           The fact that the colors come with some delay after opening the document or typing doesn't hurt my user experience at all.
        </p>
        <h3>Transformers</h3>
        <div style='text-align: center'>
            <img width='400px' src='assets/transformer.svg'></img>
        </div>
        <p>The next obvious step was to use the transformer architecture in the models and without much surprise it significantly enhanced the results.
           Another simplification was to use an output window with the same size as the input one.
           This allowed to have more flexibility and avoided cubersome padding before the input sequence.
           It also allowed us to see how much context the model needs to give the best predictions for a character by plotting the accuracy 
           position-wise.
        </p>
        <div style='text-align: center'>
            <img width='500px' src='assets/accuracy.svg'></img>
        </div>
        <p>The graph clearly shows that the model needs at least 15 characters before and after to give the best prediction.
           It is also interesting to note that the model performs slightly better on the last character than on the first one and that overall the
           last characters of the window are less affected by the lack of context than the those in the beginning of the window.
           This sounds very intuitive because programming languages are usually written from left to right.

        <h3>Recurrent Networks</h3>
        <p>I decided not to investigate the use of recurrent neural networks for this task because I didn't want to deal with the 
           problems that arise from the use of a recurrent architecture (state management/caching, longer training). However, it might 
           be interesting to see how they compare to transformers for this task.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Of course this method will not allow to replace a parser, or at least, it currently doesn't. 
           The biggest limitation is probably the difference in the outputed information. A parser outputs a syntax tree whereas the model only 
           outputs a sequence of categories.
           A syntax tree gives way more information than just the categories of of the tokens, like the context (variable declaration, 
           function invocation...) or eventual syntax errors.
           This kind of richer information is not strictly necessary for syntax highlighting but can enable very powerful editor features 
           like autocomlpletion, identifier search, auto-indentation and code reformatting.
        </p>
        <p>The other obvious drawback is that the quality of basic highlighting is still far from perfect. Even though the test score
           of the model is over 97%, those remaining 3% are very visible on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>Another less visible problem is that the dataset for the training is based on open-soure GitHub projects, and was compiled 
           some time ago.
           Even though most developers now use JS transpilers and write the most modern code that later gets translated to run on
           the widest range of browsers possible, the majority of the code from the dataset seems to be quite old in terms of javasript.
           This is very visible around <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> keywords that are much less well identified that 
           <code>var</code>. Arrow functions also seem to confuse the model.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Neural code highlighting is very interesting and promising in my opinion, with relatively little effort I was able to get 
           respectable results. Writing a parser/tokenizer with similar functionality would be a least 20 times the amount 
           of effort I put into making this.
           Moreover, I believe that in order to adapt the model to another language I would only have to swap the last few layers as opposed 
           to writing a whole new language syntax specification.
        </p>
        <p>I will keep working on this project because I am quite sure I will use my editor as a primary coding tool from now on.
           Machine Learning applied to coding tools is a very interesting and somehow underdeveloped field. The most prevalent 
           project in this domain is probably <a href='https://www.tabnine.com/'>TabNine</a> which uses a modification of GPT-2 to
           make intelligent code completions. I think that eventually the model should be trained with prediction in mind
           which opens a lot of possibilities for more intelligent features in the editor.
        </p>
